== CosX team website 

Our class has a floorball team in the Campushallen series from our first semester here at LiU. We are now into our eighth season and thus there is plenty of statistics and pictures. Previously, the material was spread across a variety of places, resulting in a low usage.    

The idea grew out of this need and this website is intended to facilitate data processing and serve as a venue to promote interest in the team. This rhyming well as we wanted to build a website from scratch.              

This website is the realization of the idea!
